commctl
=======

Preface
-------

.. _commctl_preface:

.. todo::

    Give a fuller description.

``commctl`` is the official command line utility for Commissaire.

.. include:: examples/commctl_note.rst

Installation
------------

.. todo::

    Explain when you'd want to install from source, docker, or rpm.

Via Source
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: examples/commctl_install_source.rst

Via Docker
~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

    TODO

Via RPM
~~~~~~~

If you want to roll your own RPM, the spec file can be found in the `Fedora package
repo <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/commissaire-client.git/tree/>`_.

On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora based systems you will also need to make sure to have an RPM build environment set up.
This includes packages such as:

* rpm-build
* redhat-rpm-config

For further dependencies please see ``BuildRequires`` in the spec file.


Configuration
-------------
``commctl`` requires a configuration file. The default path is
``~/.commissaire.json`` though it can be changed with the ``--config``/``-c``
option.


.. include:: examples/commctl_config.rst

.. note::

    At least one endpoint must be defined!

The password may be stored in the configuration file as well.

.. warning::

   The configuration file is plain text. If you choose to keep a password in the file make sure to keep the file permissions locked down.

.. include:: examples/commctl_config_with_password.rst


.. todo::

    The Kubernetes authentication plugin has not been ported yet.

If you are using the :ref:`Kubernetes authentication plugin <kubeauth>` you can opt to reuse the credentials from your kubeconfig like so:

.. note::

    If you include username/password and kubeconfig items the username/password will be ignored in favor of the kubeconfig.

.. include:: examples/commctl_config_with_kubeconfig.rst

Multiple fallback endpoints may be specified as a list. The endpoints are
tried in order until a successful connection is made.

.. include:: examples/commctl_config_multihost.rst

.. note::

    When creating a new host record the host will need to have an ssh key already generated
    and available for commissaire. The host also will need to have ssh running and the ``python``
    command must be available. If you want to bootstrap new hosts please see our :ref:`cloud_init`
    documentation.

the ``ssh_priv_key`` and ``remote_user`` from the server. The ``ssh_priv_key`` is
stored temporarily and is removed upon the completion of the connection.

``ssh`` requires one positional argument:

* ``hostname``: The address or domain of th

``ssh`` allows for N optional positional argument:

* ``extra_args``: Extra arguments to pass to the ssh command

.. include:: examples/commctl_list_hosts_in_cluster.rst



.. _commctl_passhash:

passhash
~~~~~~~~

The ``passhash`` command provides an easy way to create bcrypt2 hashes.


The quickest way to use the command is to provide no flags. This will prompt
you for the password and output the hash.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ commctl passhash
   Password:
   $2a$12$tMz3FVwwwkXoXcTvCHdNnul1wC.sBX1KyRYEB.FZ42VCPZVc5.SyW

If you have a password in a file you can use the ``--file``/``-f`` switch to
use it as the password.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ commctl passhash --file my_password.txt
   $2a$12$K5KtQ6woCJW5Y9gSC9W25eRu1rMWIT5WyLsLtauoZyB2bZQ8yjc1C

If you would like to change the strength of the hash via it's rounds you can use
``--rounds``/``-r``.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ commctl passhash --rounds 15
   Password:
   $2a$15$mTKz3Hl08AcJsK79YGk9G.RHe1P9ksr/whLyxZGsh92bvJt83mb8q


If you want to pass the password directly in the command you can use ``--password``

.. warning::

    Generally this is a bad idea as the password may be kept in shell history and
    will be viewable by anyone else with access to the terminal.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ commctl passhash --password bad_idea
   $2a$12$BJZYMKFEvG1osE5YXBxwIOMEHCpvHu8IlSnVpE6L0JbuhNCa.Lj.C
